Marked Exercise 2    <br/>
Design<br/>
•Design a suitable struct data type for your polynomial - i.e. decide on how you plan to store polynomials.<br/>
•Feel free (not required) to typedef your struct to a more convenient name.<br/>
•For each operations, write down a specifications as discussed in the Seven Steps of Systematic Program Construction.<br/>
•Then decide how the user will see your operations and write down function<br/>
prototypes (function declarations) for all operations.<br/>
•For each operation, develop an algorithm in pseudo-code, test it (desktop testing) and repeat this until you are happy that your algorithm is working correctly.<br/>
•Implement each operation in the C programming language.<br/>
•Once your data type and all functions are implemented, design a test main-function  (in  a  separate  file)  to  verify  that your  implementation  complies with your specification.  Keep in mind, that testing is a destructive process, i.e. the tester does his best to break the program.  If the tester cannot cause your program to crash on purpose, you can be confident, that a user will not  crash  your  program  by  accident.   Pay  particular  attention  to  border cases and illegal values for parameter.<br/>
• You  must  provide  your  own  Makefile  (this  must  be  written  by  yourself  - no IDE generated Makefile will be accepted). <br/>Your Makefile must have the following features:<br/>
–Use separate targets for compilation and linking.<br/>
–Use at least one make file variable.<br/>
–Provide a “clean” target that removes temporary files, object files and executables created by this Makefile.<br/>
–Does not use any implicit rules<br/>
–Running make without a target should compile & link your application and also automatically execute your application.<br/>
